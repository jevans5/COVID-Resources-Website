HEALTHCARE

If you lost your job due to COVID19, you can enroll in the Affordable Care Act for health insurance.

If you've lost health insurance because of COVID-19,  quit or got fired from a job, you have 60 days to enroll in the federal exchanges of the Affordable Care Act by going to www.healthcare.gov.

The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office is fighting for U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to reopen ACA enrollment for ALL people. 
But right now, if you are unemployed, you CAN enroll. https://www.healthcare.gov/
